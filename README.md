## About

This is my first attempt at learning how to code games. The original credit goes to:
https://github.com/danirod/jumpdontdie as well as their youtube video on how to make games.
Hopefully you all like the modifications, as small as they might be,
and hopefully I can provide more entertaining content in the future.
